# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-19

First implementation release.

### Added

- Atomic `open`, `head`, `at`, and `transact` core with a GitMap interface.
- Shell, isomorphic-git, and in-memory backends with object-ID equivalence.
- Filesystem, key-value, and unstorage adapters.
- Compare-and-swap replay, writer/sequence idempotency, and remote lease support.

### Reliability

- Bounded transaction-receipt recovery with loud horizon failures in both Git backends.
- Durable object/ref writes, strict path and UTF-8 validation, and writer-generation ownership.
- Conformance coverage for concurrent writers, conflict semantics, README examples, packaging, and backend parity.
